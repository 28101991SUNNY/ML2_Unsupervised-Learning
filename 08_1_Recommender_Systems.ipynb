This is an example of a content-based approach.\n","\n","\n","\n","- Each type of system has its strengths and weaknesses.\n","- In the above example, Last.fm requires a large amount of information about a user to make accurate recommendations.\n","- This is an example of the cold start problem, and is common in collaborative filtering systems.\n","- Whereas Pandora needs very little information to start, it is far more limited in scope (for example, it can only make recommendations that are similar to the original seed).\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"M_kk-sTAKCvR"},"source":["## Approaches\n","\n","### Collaborative filtering\n","\n","   \n","- Collaborative filtering is based on the assumption that people who agreed in the past will agree in the future, and that they will like similar kinds of items as they liked in the past.\n","- The system generates recommendations using only information about rating profiles for different users or items. \n","- By locating peer users/items with a rating history similar to the current user or item, they generate recommendations using this neighborhood. \n","- Collaborative filtering methods are classified as memory-based and model-based. \n","- A well-known example of memory-based approaches is the user-based algorithm, while that of model-based approaches is Matrix factorization (recommender systems).\n","\n","\n","- A key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an \"understanding\" of the item itself.\n","- Many algorithms have been used in measuring user similarity or item similarity in recommender systems. For example, the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) approach and the Pearson Correlation as first implemented by Allen.\n","\n","\n","- When building a model from a user's behavior, a distinction is often made between explicit and implicit forms of data collection.\n","\n","\n","- Examples of explicit data collection include the following:\n","\n","    - Asking a user to rate an item on a sliding scale.\n","    - Asking a user to search.\n","    - Asking a user to rank a collection of items from favorite to least favorite.\n","    - Presenting two items to a user and asking him/her to choose the better one of them.\n","    - Asking a user to create a list of items that he/she likes \n","    \n","- Examples of implicit data collection include the following:\n","    - Observing the items that a user views in an online store.\n","    - Analyzing item/user viewing times.\n","    - Keeping a record of the items that a user purchases online.\n","    - Obtaining a list of items that a user has listened to or watched on his/her computer.\n","    - Analyzing the user's social network and discovering similar likes and dislikes.\n","  \n","  \n","- Collaborative filtering approaches often suffer from three problems: cold start, scalability, and sparsity.\n","\n","    - Cold start:\n","        - For a new user or item, there isn't enough data to make accurate recommendations. Note: one commonly implemented solution to this problem is the Multi-armed bandit algorithm.\n","    - Scalability: \n","        - There are millions of users and products in many of the environments in which these systems make recommendations. Thus, a large amount of computation power is often necessary to calculate recommendations.\n","    - Sparsity:\n","        - The number of items sold on major e-commerce sites is extremely large. \n","        - The most active users will only have rated a small subset of the overall database. \n","        - Thus, even the most popular items have very few ratings.\n","        \n","- One of the most famous examples of collaborative filtering is item-to-item collaborative filtering (people who buy x also buy y), an algorithm popularized by Amazon.com's recommender system.\n","\n","\n","- Many social networks originally used collaborative filtering to recommend new friends, groups, and other social connections by examining the network of connections between a user and their friends.\n","- Collaborative filtering is still used as part of hybrid systems.\n","\n","\n","### Content-based filtering\n","\n","- Another common approach when designing recommender systems is content-based filtering.\n","- Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user's preferences.\n","- These methods are best suited to situations where there is known data on an item (name, location, description, etc.), but not on the user.\n","- Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on an item's features.\n","\n","\n","- In this system, keywords are used to describe the items, and a user profile is built to indicate the type of item this user likes. \n","- In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items similar to those that a user liked in the past or is examining in the present.\n","- It does not rely on a user sign-in mechanism to generate this often temporary profile. In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user, and the best-matching items are recommended.\n","- This approach has its roots in information retrieval and information filtering research.\n","\n","\n","- To create a user profile, the system mostly focuses on two types of information:\n","\n","    1. A model of the user's preference.\n","\n","    2. A history of the user's interaction with the recommender system.\n","\n","- Basically, these methods use an item profile (i.e., a set of discrete attributes and features) characterizing the item within the system.\n","- To abstract the features of the items in the system, an item presentation algorithm is applied.\n","- A widely used algorithm is the tf–idf representation (also called vector space representation).\n","- The system creates a content-based profile of users based on a weighted vector of item features. \n","- The weights denote the importance of each feature to the user and can be computed from individually rated content vectors using a variety of techniques. \n","- Simple approaches use the average values of the rated item vector while other sophisticated methods use machine learning techniques such as Bayesian Classifiers, cluster analysis, decision trees, and artificial neural networks in order to estimate the probability that the user is going to like the item.\n","\n","\n","\n","- A key issue with content-based filtering is whether the system can learn user preferences from users' actions regarding one content source and use them across other content types. \n","- When the system is limited to recommending content of the same type as the user is already using, the value from the recommendation system is significantly less than when other content types from other services can be recommended. \n","- For example, recommending news articles based on news browsing is useful. Still, it would be much more useful when music, videos, products, discussions, etc., from different services, can be recommended based on news browsing. To overcome this, most content-based recommender systems now use some form of the hybrid system.\n","\n","\n","- Content-based recommender systems can also include opinion-based recommender systems. \n","- In some cases, users are allowed to leave text reviews or feedback on the items.\n","- These user-generated texts are implicit data for the recommender system because they are potentially rich resources of both feature/aspects of the item and users' evaluation/sentiment to the item.\n","- Features extracted from the user-generated reviews are improved meta-data of items, because as they also reflect aspects of the item like meta-data, extracted features are widely concerned by the users. \n","- Sentiments extracted from the reviews can be seen as users' rating scores on the corresponding features.\n","- Popular approaches of opinion-based recommender system utilize various techniques including text mining, information retrieval, sentiment analysis (see also Multimodal sentiment analysis) and deep learning.\n","\n","\n","### Hybrid recommendations approaches\n","\n","-  combining collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and other approaches.\n","- There is no reason why several different techniques of the same type could not be hybridized.\n","- Hybrid approaches can be implemented in several ways:\n","    - by making content-based and collaborative-based predictions separately and then combining them;\n","    - by adding content-based capabilities to a collaborative-based approach (and vice versa); or \n","    - by unifying the approaches into one model \n","- Several studies that empirically compare the performance of the hybrid with the pure collaborative and content-based methods and demonstrated that the hybrid methods can provide more accurate recommendations than pure approaches.\n","- These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem, as well as the knowledge engineering bottleneck in knowledge-based approaches.\n","\n","\n","\n","- Netflix is a good example of the use of hybrid recommender systems.\n","- The website makes recommendations by comparing the watching and searching habits of similar users (i.e., collaborative filtering) as well as by offering movies that share characteristics with films that a user has rated highly (content-based filtering).\n","\n","\n","- Some hybridization techniques include:\n","    - Weighted: \n","        - Combining the score of different recommendation components numerically.\n","    - Switching: \n","        - Choosing among recommendation components and applying the selected one.\n","    - Mixed: \n","        - Recommendations from different recommenders are presented together to give the recommendation.\n","    - Feature Combination:\n","        - Features derived from different knowledge sources are combined together and given to a single recommendation algorithm.\n","    - Feature Augmentation: \n","        - Computing a feature or set of features, which is then part of the input to the next technique.\n","    - Cascade:\n","        - Recommenders are given strict priority, with the lower priority ones breaking ties in the scoring of the higher ones.\n","    - Meta-level:\n","        - One recommendation technique is applied and produces some sort of model, which is then the input used by the next technique.\n","        \n","        \n","        "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OX7tMPS7KCvT"},"source":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"4G_-y1EAKCvU"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning"],"metadata":{"id":"bMGSifRQKkiv"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Apriori\n","\n","-  an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over relational databases. \n","\n","- It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. \n","\n","- The frequent item sets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has applications in domains such as market basket analysis.\n","\n","## Association rule learning\n","\n","\n","- Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. \n","\n","- It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness.\n","\n","- In any given transaction with a variety of items, association rules are meant to discover the rules that determine how or why certain items are connected.\n","\n","- Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. \n","\n","- For example, the rule {onions,potatoes}⇒{burger} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat.
